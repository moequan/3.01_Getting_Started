//**Comparison Operators Exercises**

var x=20;
var y=30;

//1. Check whether x and y are equal.

console.log (x==y); //false

//2. Check whether x and y are **not** equal.

console.log (x!==y); //false

//3. Check whether x is greater than y.

console.log (x > y); //false

//4. Check whether x is less than or equal to y.

console.log (x <= y); //true

//5. Check whether y is greater than x.

console.log (y > x) //true

//6. Declare another variable "z" and give it a value of 5. Multiply z and x and, check whether this result is greater than z added to y.

var z=5;
console.log (z*x > z+y) //true

//7. Subtract z from x and check whether this result is less than y divided by z.

console.log ((x-z) < (z/y));  //false 

//8. Check whether z, x and y are equal.

console.log (z==x==y)  //false

//9. Check whether the remainder of x divided by z and the remainder of y divided by z are equal.


console.log ((x%z)==(y%z))

//10. Check whether z added to x is greater than y minus z. If it is not, find an operator which will give a result of true.


console.log (z+x > y-z); //false
console.log (z+x >! y-z); //true
